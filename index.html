          <p>Hello world! I'm Ernesto Garcia an animator from Tepic Nayarit that has been living in Monterrey for
            the past 8 years I graduted from a design school near la Huasteca called "CEDIM" about 3 years now, since
            then I've been working on several projects from making animated traning videos for companies abroad to
            working on an animated movie here in San Pedro where I was the set supervisor, I had to deliver the
            scenes to the lighting deparment in the final stage of modeling, I was also in charge of a group of
            modelers who were in charge of replacing the low poly scenes with those of high poly, sadly the project
            ran out of money and I had to leave.</p>

          <p>Now I'm working as a community manager in a company here in Monterrey and also as a freelancer for
            another company doing some 3d modeling and 3d motion graphics, and now that my schedule is a little
            loose I figured out that i have the time to learn something new, that is why im planning on learn the
            prestigious art of web development.</p>

          <p>So another chapter of my boring life starts here, sit tight cuz we are about to go on board on a
            challenging journey, stay tune and good night.</p>
